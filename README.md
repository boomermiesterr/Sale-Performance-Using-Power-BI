## Objective of the Dashboard
The objective of the dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of sales
performance and key business metrics, allowing users to analyze data, interact with
visualizations using slicers, and make informed decisions.
- Monitoring Sales Performance
The dashboard displays metrics such as Total Sales (e.g., 1.4M) and Product Sold (51K).
This helps evaluate yearly sales growth, identify trends, and monitor overall business
growth. Users can leverage slicers to filter data by specific time periods, product
categories, or customer segments for more targeted insights.
- Analyzing Profitability
Profitability is analyzed by showcasing Profit (406.34K) compared to the previous year
(Vs PY, +0.35%), enabling users to track financial health and assess profit margins.
Slicers allow users to focus on profitability across specific regions, products, or shipping
methods for better decision-making.
- Evaluating Product Performance
The dashboard provides visuals like Sales CY (Current Year) and PY (Prior Year) by
product and monthly trends, helping identify top-performing and underperforming
products for strategic adjustments. Slicers can be used to filter performance by product
categories or sales periods, providing a clearer view of product trends.
- Customer Segmentation by Country
Customer segmentation is visualized using a pie chart showing sales by country (e.g.,
USA, Germany), allowing analysis of regional performance and supporting locationspecific strategies. With slicers, users can filter data by country or customer type to
- analyze specific markets.
Shipping and Operational Efficiency
Shipping and operational efficiency are analyzed through line charts comparing profit by
shipping companies, enabling optimization of delivery methods and operational cost
control. Slicers can help narrow down performance data for specific shipping companies
or timeframes.
- Employee Sales Contributions
Employee performance is evaluated using visuals like Sales CY and PY by employee,
helping recognize top contributors and assess their impact on overall sales. By using
slicers, users can filter sales data by employee names or teams to gain detailed insights.
- Geographic Sales Distribution
Geographic sales distribution is represented on maps, showing sales by region and
highlighting high and low-performing areas for targeted growth. Slicers allow users to
drill down into specific regions, focusing on areas of interest.
